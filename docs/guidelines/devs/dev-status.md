## Developers must do the following to keep in good standing:

- When planning to work on a new game, claim the game before starting work on it.
- Only claim games when you are [free of unaddressed tickets](/guidelines/dev-coc/#handling-tickets).
- Keep your work free from [unwelcome concepts](/guidelines/unwelcome-concepts/).
- Use [protective code](/guidelines/achievement-set-requirements/), preventing potential cheating and exploits.
- Leave accurate [code notes](/guidelines/achievement-set-requirements/#code-notes) for each achievement condition you use.
- For set revisions, follow the [revision policy](/guidelines/revision-guidelines/).
- [Resolve tickets](/guidelines/dev-coc/#handling-tickets) and leave notes each time you do.
- Like a wiki, once you publish your work, you are giving it over to the community to be [reviewed and reworked over time](/guidelines/dev-coc/#achievement-ownership).

## Changing Accounts

If a user with either Developer or Jr. Developer status changes accounts, achievements and tickets under the old account will be re-authored and reassigned to the new account.

## Inactivity

If a user is inactive as a developer for 6 months or inactive overall for 3 months, their developer status will expire and their account type will be set to `[Registered]`. It is important for developers to remember that this is **NOT** a punishment and is only done for security reasons!

If **all of the following** are true for at least 6 months, then a user will be considered inactive as a developer:
- Has not made or renewed a set claim.
- Has not created new achievements.
- Has not performed maintenance on existing sets (revisions, rescores, badge changes, etc.)
- Has not resolved, closed, or otherwise addressed any open tickets, theirs or otherwise.

## Negligence

Alternatively, developer status will be removed if the developer has 10 or more tickets that are at least 2 months old. If the developer has any active claims during this period, they will be given an additional 30 days or until the earliest claim renewal (whichever comes first) to resolve all 10 tickets. Not doing so will result in the developer falling into inactive status and the claim(s) being released.

## Reinstatement

If a user's developer status was removed due to inactivity and they wish to have it reinstated, they must contact Dev-Compliance. However, before doing so, it is recommended to review any changes that were made to the Developer Code of Conduct, updates to the achievement creation tools, and have a plan to address open tickets for their achievements, if applicable.

The steps involved in reinstatement will vary from user to user depending on the following:
- The amount of time elapsed since developer status was removed.
- The amount of tickets that may have been opened on their achievements. 
- Other QA issues that may have come up since developer status was removed.
- Moderation warnings or actions the user may have received.

A user may be required to submit work to code reviewers if more than a year has passed since their developer status was removed or if they initially obtained developer status before the junior developer program existed (July 2018) and did not retroactively obtain the Junior Developer badge.

*Note: Achievements edited by other developers will not count against a user seeking reinstatement.*
